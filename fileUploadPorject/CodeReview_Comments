Review 1 (28/08/2018):

1. Use opencsv to parse the file
2. Use lombok for setter/getters/constructors
3. logging.file is used in application.properties but not used.
4. Use static package of springboot to write Front end OR use thymeleaf plugin
5. WebControllerIndex.fileUpload -- rewrite using java.nio.files package. (Java 8)
6. Use interfaces
7. Use logical names for variables, classes, packages, etc
8. Seggregate functionality as per feature
9. Why are you using jstl and tomcat-embed-jasper. JSP are out of league now. Use html, css bootstrap
        OR
   Use angular 4/5/6
10. @Controller -- use RestConstoller instead
    @RequestMapping -- It is outdated now. Use annotations like @GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc.
